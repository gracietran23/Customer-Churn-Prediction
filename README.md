# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect of business management, particularly for industries like telecommunications, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services. It involves understanding and addressing customer attrition, which refers to the loss of clients or customers.

## Importance of Customer Retention

Retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one, so it's important to know the factors that lead to customer churn, thereby maximizing their likelihood of staying.

## Methods Used

To analyze and predict customer churn, the following methods were employed:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  
- **Binary Classification using a Random Forest Model**: A Random Forest model was utilized to classify customers into churn or non-churn categories based on various attributes.
  
- **Implementation in Python**: The analysis and modeling were conducted using Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Data

- The dataset used for this analysis includes 20 attributes, with the target attribute being 'Churn'.
- The data was split into a train set consisting of 2666 rows and a test set containing 667 rows.
    - Use **train** set to **build** model
    - Use **test** set to **validate** the predictions and **evaluate** accuracy of model

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to understand which factors contribute to and impact customer churn, ultimately aiding businesses in devising effective strategies for customer retention.

For detailed implementation and analysis, refer to the provided Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks in the repository.
